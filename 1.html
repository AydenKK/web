  <h2>Who I am</h2>
  I like <strong>sharing <u>thoughts</u></strong>. It always inspires me and motivates me
  <br><br><strong>"Instead of trying to fix her problem, you just listen. People who are struggling emotionally often just need to be heard."</strong> -
  Dr. Sturgis from <a href="https://www.cbs.com/shows/young-sheldon/" target="_blank" title="Young Sheldon official website">Young Sheldon</a>
  <p>I was really able to resonate with this quote. When I was suffering from depression, I just wanted to be heard.
  But I didn't have anyone who listened to me.</p>
  <p>Now I have one. My acupuncturist. He is the only person who cares about my pain, my day, and my health.
  He might be listening to me because of money i'm paying, but i don't have anybody.
  I just want to be heard. Or he really does care about me.
  I choose to believe that. Before I met him, I was really lonely and feeling severely depressed but now i feel better.</p>
  That's why I go there to see him, even though his acupuncture skill doesn't seem to be working.
