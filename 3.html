  <p>visited grandma's today. Had gram's spicy chicken which is my favorite,
    watched TV together, and also made a video of us eating dinner together.
    I felt like this might be the last time of us having dinner all together.
    생각났을때 안찍으면 나중엔 아예 생각조차 안날것 같아서. </p>
    <p> The fact that I don't have many years left with my grandparents
      always makes me feel weird. It's just werid, not sad. Of course I'd be sad
      But it's more than that. I don't know what it is. Maybe it's scary
      or it could be overwhelming. I've never experienced any death of my close family.
      So I just can't imagine how that would be like. </P>
  <P><mark>But the most important thing is that we had a good time together.</mark> </p>
