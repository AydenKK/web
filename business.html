  <h2>Business career</h2>
<p>
  In 2001, Musk became involved with the nonprofit Mars Society.
  He was inspired by plans to place a growth-chamber for plants on Mars
  and discussed funding the project himself.[64] In October 2001,
  Musk traveled to Moscow to buy refurbished Intercontinental ballistic missiles
  (ICBMs) that could send the greenhouse payloads into space.
  He met with companies NPO Lavochkin and Kosmotras; however,
  Musk was seen as a novice and was even spat on by one of the Russian chief designers.
  The group returned to the United States empty-handed.
  In February 2002, the group returned to Russia to look for three ICBMs.</p>

  <p>
  They had another meeting with Kosmotras and were offered one rocket for $8 million,
  which Musk rejected.
  Musk instead decided to start a company that could build affordable rockets.
  With $100 million of his early fortune,
  Musk founded Space Exploration Technologies Corp.,
  traded as SpaceX, in May 2002.
  As of 2021, he remains the company's CEO and also holds the title of Chief Engineer.
