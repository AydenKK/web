  Musk made $165 million when PayPal was sold to eBay in 2002.
  He was first listed on the Forbes Billionaires List in 2012,
  with a net worth of $2 billion.
  At the start of 2020, Musk had a net worth of $27 billion.
  Throughout that year, his net worth increased by $150 billion,
  largely driven by his ownership of around 20% of

  stock.

  During this, Musk's net worth was often volatile.
  For example, it dropped $16.3 billion in September,
  the largest single-day plunge in the history of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.
